It is located at the insertion of the adductor magnus aponeurosis or the origin of the medial head of the gastrocnemius tendon. It is typically seen in patients ages 15 to 20 years and may be a reaction to trauma. On radiographs, it demonstrates a saucer-like lucent defect. It is typically hypointense on T1-weighted MR images and hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images. It is a benign finding, and no further imaging is needed.",

This patient is 15 years old; therefore, the elbow should be ossified. There is a lucency noted in the medial epicondyle, which, given the history of a throwing athlete, is most consistent with an avulsion of the medial epicondyle at the ulnar collateral ligament attachment. In younger patients, before there is complete ossification of the elbow, a similar injury can be caused by avulsion from excessive pull of the common flexor tendon. The ulnar attachment of the ulnar collateral ligament is the sublime tubercle; however, no radiographic abnormality is noted in this location. Medial epicondylitis is related to tendinosis of the common flexor tendon and would not cause the finding noted in this patient.",
