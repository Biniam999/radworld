Fibromatosis usually occurs at the medial non–weight-bearing surface of the plantar fascia. Forestier disease is also known as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) and involves the spine. Plantar fasciopathy or fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain and is characterized by thickening of the fascia, usually at the calcaneal margin, with variable degrees of soft tissue and osseous inflammation.

Some studies suggest the etiology of this lesion to be related to a reparative process after periosteal injury, while others point to a benign neoplastic process as its cause. Osteochondromas must demonstrate corticomedullary contiguity. Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma are rare in this location and would have a more aggressive appearance.

It has a predilection for the intertrochanteric region of the femur. Lesions are often discovered incidentally, but may be related to nonspecific pain or, less commonly, pathologic fracture. Differential considerations include fibrous dysplasia and involuting, intraosseous lipoma. Lymphangioma is a developmental, soft tissue lesion of dilated lymphatic channels. Hemangiopericytoma is a vascular lesion of intermediate malignancy. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a neoplastic disease primarily of childhood characterized by proliferation of Langerhans cells. Osseous lesions are lytic with radiologic features such as periosteal reaction, endosteal scalloping, cortical breakthrough, and no sclerotic margin.",

Bone metastases have been reported to occur in approximately 30% of patients with RCC. Metastatic lesions in RCC are typically expansile, lytic, and hypervascular. Neuroblastoma is a tumor of childhood, most commonly affecting those 5 years and younger. Blastic, not lytic, metastases are typical for prostate carcinoma. Lytic metastasis may be seen in papillary thyroid carcinoma, although uncommon (1% to 7%).",
