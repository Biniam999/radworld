In younger patients, before there is complete ossification of the elbow, a similar injury can be caused by avulsion from excessive pull of the common flexor tendon. The ulnar attachment of the ulnar collateral ligament is the sublime tubercle; however, no radiographic abnormality is noted in this location.

T1-weighted MRI demonstrates low to isointense signal intensity and fluid sensitive sequences demonstrate heterogeneous signal intensity. Contrast enhancement is variable. Fibromatosis usually occurs at the medial non–weight-bearing surface of the plantar fascia. Forestier disease is also known as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) and involves the spine. Plantar fasciopathy or fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain and is characterized by thickening of the fascia, usually at the calcaneal margin, with variable degrees of soft tissue and osseous inflammation.
